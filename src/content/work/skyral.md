Engineer and squad lead on the Urban Digital Twins team, where I built out traffic and human behaviour modelling to reach state of the art scale (10+ million entities). I work closely with applied scientists and researchers to translate theory into high performance implementation in modern, data oriented C++. I also help manage customer deployments, using Kubernetes and bespoke Python tooling to ensure our models can be configured and reused across projects.
