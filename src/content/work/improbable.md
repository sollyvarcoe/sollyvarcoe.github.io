Heavily involved in the design and implementation of Python simulation and modelling library, achieving 100x performance increase over previous iterations. Implemented with C++/Cython using NumPy recarrays, designed with developer experience in mind following pythonic best practices. My contributions were end to end, including gathering requirements, writing architecture documents, prioritising work and keeping stakeholders informed.
