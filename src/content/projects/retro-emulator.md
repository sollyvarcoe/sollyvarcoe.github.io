## Retro Gaming Emulator

A personal project exploring the fascinating world of vintage gaming hardware through software emulation.

### Key Features

- **Cycle-accurate emulation** for authentic gameplay experience
- **Modern C++** implementation with focus on performance
- **Cross-platform** support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Debugging tools** for understanding original hardware behavior

### Technical Highlights

- Low-level hardware simulation
- Custom CPU instruction set implementation  
- Graphics pipeline emulation
- Sound synthesis

This project combines my interests in programming language implementation, performance optimization, and gaming history.

*Repository coming soon!*
